ElastiServe

## Description

This project leverages the power of AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to streamline the deployment and management of a web application. By utilizing AWS CDK's capabilities, we can seamlessly package the web application source code, provision the required deployment infrastructure using AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, and establish a robust CI/CD pipeline through AWS CDK Pipelines.
