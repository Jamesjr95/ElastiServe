## Project Name
ElastiServe

## Description

This project leverages the power of AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to streamline the deployment and management of a web application. By utilizing AWS CDK's capabilities, we can seamlessly package the web application source code, provision the required deployment infrastructure using AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, and establish a robust CI/CD pipeline through AWS CDK Pipelines.

## Features

- Automated Deployment: The project incorporates AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of deployment infrastructure, enabling rapid and consistent deployment of the web     application.

- Packaging Efficiency: Leveraging AWS CDK, the web application's source code is efficiently packaged, ensuring smooth distribution and optimal performance.

- Scalability and Reliability: By utilizing AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, the deployment infrastructure is dynamically scalable, allowing the application to handle varying 
workloads and ensuring high availability.

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment: The project integrates AWS CDK Pipelines to establish a robust CI/CD pipeline, enabling automated and efficient delivery of application updates and enhancements.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account and CLI installed.
- CDK installed.
- A GitHub account.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)**: AWS CDK is an open-source software development framework that allows developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. It provisions the defined infrastructure through AWS CloudFormation. AWS CDK consists of three major components: a core framework for modeling reusable infrastructure components, a CLI for interacting with the framework, and a Construct Library that provides high-level, abstracted components of AWS resources.

- **CDK Pipelines**: CDK Pipelines is a high-level construct library that simplifies the setup of continuous deployment pipelines for AWS CDK applications. It is powered by AWS CodePipeline and allows for easy integration of CI/CD workflows into the development process.

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that makes it easy to deploy and scale web applications and services. It supports multiple programming languages and platforms and abstracts away the underlying infrastructure details. It allows developers to simply upload their application code and Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

- **AWS CodePipeline**: AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for applications. It provides a graphical user interface and allows developers to define custom release processes and workflows.

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used in this project to create a simple non-containerized web application.

These technologies work together to streamline the development process, enabling the creation of a non-containerized Node.js web application, packaging the source code using AWS CDK, creating the deployment infrastructure with AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CDK Pipelines powered by AWS CodePipeline.
