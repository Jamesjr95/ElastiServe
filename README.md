## Project Name
ElastiServe

## Description

This project leverages the power of AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to streamline the deployment and management of a web application. By utilizing AWS CDK's capabilities, we can seamlessly package the web application source code, provision the required deployment infrastructure using AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, and establish a robust CI/CD pipeline through AWS CDK Pipelines.

## Features

- Automated Deployment: The project incorporates AWS CDK to automate the provisioning of deployment infrastructure, enabling rapid and consistent deployment of the web     application.

- Packaging Efficiency: Leveraging AWS CDK, the web application's source code is efficiently packaged, ensuring smooth distribution and optimal performance.

- Scalability and Reliability: By utilizing AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, the deployment infrastructure is dynamically scalable, allowing the application to handle varying 
workloads and ensuring high availability.

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment: The project integrates AWS CDK Pipelines to establish a robust CI/CD pipeline, enabling automated and efficient delivery of application updates and enhancements.
